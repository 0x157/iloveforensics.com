**I am a 19-year-old `cybersecurity` student with a big interest in Digital Forensics, Incident Response, and Radio Frequency Communications. I am thrilled to welcome you to my personal website!**

**Every weekend I play with **`L3ak`** a competitive CTF team where I main `Forensics` & `Misc`, while learning reverse engineering on the side. CTF's are highly competitive events that challenge participants to solve security-related problems and puzzles.**

**When I'm not playing CTF's or doing uni assignments, I dedicate my time studying certifications. As of now, I hold several key certifications that highlight commitment to the field.**
    
**`CompTIA CySA+`** `CompTIA Security+` `Blue Team Level 1` `CompTIA ITF+ (xD)`

**At times I'm bored, I enjoy playing on [Blue Team Labs](https://blueteamlabs.online/public/user/0x157), where I'm currently ranked `4th` in USA, placing me in the top 0.02% globally. Additionally, I'm looking forward to clearing [HTB](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1029758) forensics sometime in the near future. As of now I have a 65% solve percentage.**
